    <p>Save your money for targeted goals and get returns at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>This savings can be towards a specific goal like school fees, or for paying rent.</p>
    <p>This package is for daily contribution; you will collect the total amount at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>It works like this.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You decide the amount you want to be saving daily.</li>
        <li>Buy the card and start saving.</li>
